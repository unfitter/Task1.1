Creating 2 users:
adduser Raymond
adduser John
Now, in the home directory we have 2 more directories for John and Raymond

SSH connection:
cd home/Raymond
mkdir .ssh
ssh-keygen
Transfering public key to the server(the second virtual machine with diffrent ip-address):
Connecting to the server via ssh, when we are in server's terminal:
cd home/Raymond
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh
vim authorized_keys
Then just copy and paste public key into this file
Changing modes:
  On the server:
  chmod 700 /home/raymond/.ssh/
  chmod 600 /home/raymond/.ssh/*
ssh raymond@192.168.126.133
We dont have to put a password anymore from the Raymond but John has to put a password everytime he wants to connect to server. 
Additinal, on our main machine we need to change owner of the directory Raymond:
chown Raymond Raymond
chmod 700 home/Raymond/.ssh/

Giving root permission to Raymond:
  usermod -aG sudo Raymond
Restrict access to sudo for John:
  1)sudo -su
  2)Backup the /etc/sudoers config file:
    cp -p /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.ORIG
  3)Edit the /etc/sudoers config file:
    visudo -f /etc/sudoers
    ##Limit the John user to run any command (enabled for patching from oracle platnum support), except for sudo su to root
    John ALL = ALL, !/bin/su
    
Creating a document from Raymond:
vim document.txt
    :wq
chmod 644 home/Raymond/document.txt
Creating a bash script from John:
vim script.sh
    :wq
chmod 601 script.sh

Changing shell for John:
chsh -s /bin/bash John

Create new user with sh shell:
useradd -m -s /bin/sh Watson

Working with groups:
groupadd John
usermod -a -G John Watson

SCP:
vim transfer.txt
scp transfer.txt raymond@192.168.126.133:/home/raymond
